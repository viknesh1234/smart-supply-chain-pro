A modular supply chain management system with two main components:

- **inventory-system**: Manage warehouse inventoryâ€”track stock, add, update, and view items.
- **smart-supply-horizon**: Intelligent forecasting module for supply chain planning.

Built using **TypeScript** (frontend and/or backend) with supplemental **Java** services.
